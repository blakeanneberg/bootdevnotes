## Unit Tests
- DEF: Is an automated program that tests a small unit of code, usually a function or two, testing functionality rather than output, call functions in code with different arguments, and expect certain return values. If code returnes correct values, you pass, if not, you fail. 
- Run and debug code with `print` statements, and leave print statements in when you submit.
